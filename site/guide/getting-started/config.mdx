# Configuring

So far we've been working without a configuration file which is easy but not very flexible. 

In this guide we'll add a **bud.config.js** file to our build so that we have a little more control.

## Create bud.config.js

Create a file titled **bud.config.js** file in the project root. 

This file exports a single function that will tell **bud** to generate an html file for our application.

```js title='bud.config.js'
module.exports = bud => bud.template()
```

## Rerun the build

With the **bud.config.js** in place re-run the build using **bud build**.

You'll see the **index.html** file is being generated.

```shell {3} title='$ bud build'
bud

- index.html                         467 bytes
- main.js         minimized          56 bytes
- main.css        minimized          51 bytes
