In the future `bud doctor` will do other checks to help keep projects healthy.

For now, it simply checks your package.json against the extensions you have installed and provides feedback if anything is missing.

<CodeBlock title='$ yarn bud doctor --help'>{Help}</CodeBlock>

## Success

Running `bud doctor` in a project that meets requirements:

<CodeBlock title='$ yarn bud doctor'>{Success}</CodeBlock>

## Failure

Running `bud doctor` in a project that does not meet requirements:

<CodeBlock title='$ yarn bud doctor'>{Fail}</CodeBlock>

In the event of a failure, you may install the missing extensions with **bud init**.
